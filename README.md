Via Python

This is a very popular text for an introduction to machine learning (written by some legends, and they made it free!). However, it's all in R, so I thought it would be a good exercise to rework the exercises in Python. Since R is a language more or less designed for statistical analysis, and most of Python's statistical abilities came later, there are some differences; in some cases, what was easy in R is more difficult in Python, but there are some things that are easier with Python as well.

Someone more experienced than me may have better ways of doing some of these exercises, so if you have some comments or criticisms, feel free to email me at b.lee.armstrong@gmail.com
