    "Trying to get a better understanding of various data analysis packages in Python, I thought it would be a good idea to work through the ISLR, using Python instead of R. Many default tools in R are only available as outside packages in Python, so in many cases, it won't be as easy to do this in Python, but it shouldn't be too difficult. We'll start with the exercises found in the applied section in chapter 3."
